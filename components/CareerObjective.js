      <p>As a BS-Computer Science student, I am looking forward 
to a bright coding future. And as practical experience is 
essential, I really want to work with my seniors to gain 
strong hands-on coding experience. As in my 
academic career, I've sought to consistently perform at an 
outstanding level, and I intend to bring the same success 
and passion to my professional development. </p>
